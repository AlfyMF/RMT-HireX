3️⃣ UI Alignment / Form Fixes

Problem: When tooltips are added to fields without adding a new field, the form shows misalignment (labels, inputs, or dropdowns are shifted).

Solution Requirements:

Tooltip Placement:

Tooltip icon should be aligned inline with the field label.

Tooltip should not push or shift the input field.

Maintain consistent spacing with other fields.

Field Alignment:

Ensure all labels and input components (dropdowns, multi-selects) line up vertically and horizontally.

Maintain equal spacing between fields.

Fix any wrapping issues when tooltips are present.

Responsive Layout:

UI should look consistent in desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

Multi-select dropdown widths should not exceed container width when tooltips are present.

Validation Messages:

Error messages or hints should appear below the input field, not pushing other fields out of alignment.

Fix UI alignment issues in the form (particularly when tooltips are added).
