3️⃣ UI Alignment / Form Fixes
Problem: When tooltips are added to fields without adding a new field, the form shows misalignment (labels, inputs, or dropdowns are shifted).
Solution Requirements:
1. Tooltip Placement:
    * Tooltip icon should be aligned inline with the field label.
    * Tooltip should not push or shift the input field.
    * Maintain consistent spacing with other fields.
2. Field Alignment:
    * Ensure all labels and input components (dropdowns, multi-selects) line up vertically and horizontally.
    * Maintain equal spacing between fields.
    * Fix any wrapping issues when tooltips are present.
3. Responsive Layout:
    * UI should look consistent in desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
    * Multi-select dropdown widths should not exceed container width when tooltips are present.
4. Validation Messages:
    * Error messages or hints should appear below the input field, not pushing other fields out of alignment.
