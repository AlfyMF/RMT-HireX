Change Request: Job Requisition (JR) Form – Field Validations Integration
Scope

Implement comprehensive field-level and form-level validations across all Job Requisition (JR) forms — applicable to both Create and Edit flows.

3. Validation Behavior
Trigger Timing

Validations trigger only on Submit.

Next and Save and Continue should not invoke validations.

Error Display

Show error messages below or beside each relevant field.

If multiple fields fail, display all errors simultaneously.

Error Clearing

Once a field is corrected, its error message should disappear instantly.

Example: If “Job Type is required” appears, selecting a valid Job Type clears the error immediately.

Blocking Submission

Prevent submission if any validation fails.

No API payload should be sent until all errors are resolved.

UX Guidelines

Error messages must be:

Red-colored

Concise

Aligned with existing field layout styles

Optional fields should not trigger warnings.

4. Expected Outcome

✅ All required and range-based validations are enforced before submission
✅ Validation messages appear only when necessary and disappear upon correction
✅ Data consistency maintained before API submission
✅ Users can navigate via “Next” or “Save and Continue” freely without interruption
✅ Smooth UX and reliable backend data integrity
