1. Basic Details Section
Fixes Required:

Some existing fields are missing tooltips → Add them as per the table below.

Conditional display not working for the following fields — fix logic so these appear only under defined conditions:

Expected Date of Onboarding (Start) → Display only when Work Arrangement = Offshore

Expected Date of Onboarding (End) → Display only when Work Arrangement = Offshore

Ideal Start Date (Start) → Display only when Work Arrangement = Onsite

Ideal Start Date (End) → Display only when Work Arrangement = Onsite
